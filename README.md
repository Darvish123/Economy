# Automated Economic News Extraction and Publishing

## Project Overview
This project aims to **automatically extract the latest news and articles related to global economic markets, Forex, and cryptocurrency**.  
Google Apps Script runs every 45 minutes to fetch the newest news from ForexLive and stores the data in Google Sheets.

These data can later be automatically published to blogs, websites, or social media platforms.
